# LeetCode_Solutions
This repository holds all of my attempted LeetCode problems

All of my files are formatted in the following manner:

*    Comments at the top of the file contain the problem. It explains what the program should do,
*    and may also contain some examples. 

All of the code for the program will follow, including parameters.

*    Comments at the bottom of the file will explain my solution, and any
*    problems I may have faced during my attempt to solve the problem.

An example of this formatting is shown in the screenshot below:
