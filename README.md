# LeetCode_Solutions
## This repository holds all of my attempted LeetCode problems

### All of my files are formatted in the following manner:

*    Comments at the top of the file contain the problem. It explains what the program should do,
     and may also contain some examples.

*    If there are any functions/classes used for the problem (for example, certain linked list problems will have their own function),
     they will be located above the main function, with comments beneath them explaining their functionality.

*    All of the code for the program will follow, including parameters.

*    Comments at the bottom of the file will explain my solution, and any
     problems I may have faced during my attempt to solve the problem.

An example of this formatting is shown in the screenshot below:

 ## Grading Policy:

Information regarding the status of my progress with the problem is found in the commit history, and is 
pretty self explanatory. Here are some notes regarding how I keep track of the problem in the commit history:

*    If a program is "completed", it has passed all test cases on LeetCode.
    
*    If a program is "explained", I have commented the problem parameters at the top of the program,
     and explained how my code works at the bottom of the program.
     
*    If a program has x/y test cases passed, it means I am still working on solving it. It is important to note that
     most of the time the amount of test cases in the commit history is not equal to the actual amount of test cases
     on LeetCode. When testing your program on LeetCode, it gives a few example test cases (anywhere from 2-6, for example),
     then once those are passed, runs many more to check all possibilities (actual number of test cases is usually in the
     hundreds).
